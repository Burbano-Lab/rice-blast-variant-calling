## Repository structure
The description of the general workflow, command line and pipelines is separated into three major sections:

1. [Generation of the Gold standard variants dataset and set of filters](1_Filtering_steps.md)
2. [Effect of SNP filtered sets on population structure](2_Population_Structure.md)
3. [Effect of SNP filtered sets on the Site Frequency Spectra](3_SFS.md)
4. [Effect of SNP filtered sets on the Phylogeny](4_Phylogeny.md)

All scripts and data can be found inside the correspondent folders.
